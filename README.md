## My process
- It was quite hectic and fun at the same time while i was working on the project. I used the Mobile-first workflow which made my work very much easier.I actually thought i couldn't complete the challenge,but i'm happy i did.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned
I explored css Flexbox properties more,i also enjoyed working on the toggling classes.

```js
menu.addEventListener('click', () => {
    navBar.classList.toggle("show");
    for (let i = 0; i < navBarLinks.length; i++) {
        navBarLinks[i].classList.toggle("show"); 
    }
});
```

### Continued development

I want to continue working on projects that are related to this project because i really enjoyed it.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21976227/classlist-add-does-not-work) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand classLists. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
